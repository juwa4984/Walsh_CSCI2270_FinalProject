# Walsh_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Project Summary:  My project is basically an online makeup store.  It askes the user a few questions about their interests and will pull products according to what the customer likes.  The user can ask for information on the products if they like.  Then they choose their favorite products and they are added to the user's shoppping cart, which is an array.  At the end of the program, it will display the total cost of the items.  The items are stored in a binary search tree. 

How to Run: Compile using "g++ -std=c++11 ProjClass.cpp ProjectDriver.cpp".  Then run by typing "./a.out".
